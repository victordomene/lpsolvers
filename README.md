# LP Solving Benchmarks

This repository contains a few different implementations of LP solvers,
including Simplex with several pivot rules, Interior Point Methods, and the
Ellipsoid Algorithm. Benchmarks will be performed in the future.

## Building the Solvers

TODO.

## Benchmarks

TODO.

## TODO

- Fix equalities in MPS parser.
- Add new Pivot Rules in Simplex.
- Support IPM and Ellipsoid.
- Actually run benchmarks?!
